# Set the maximum level a player can save in a single MagicBottle.
# TIP: Set this depending on how difficult you made the recipe.
max level:
  # This will be applied when the player doesn't have any of the following permissions.
  default: 200
  permissions:
    # Allow players to have bottles with more levels than the default option.
    # To remove the limit entirely, give people 'magicbottle.maxlevel.unlimited'; still, the maximum level a bottle can hold is 20,000.
    # You need to grant people the permission 'magicbottle.maxlevel.<name>', being <name> in the list shown below.
    # If a player has two or more of these permissions, the maximum value will be applied, including 'magicbottle.maxlevel.unlimited'.
    #   For example, a Veteran user can have the permissions 'user' and 'veteran', but only 'veteran' will be applied.
    # You can modify, add or remove any of the following limits at will.
    user: 300
    veteran: 350
    vip: 400
